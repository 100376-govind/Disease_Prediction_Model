# 🦠 Disease Spreading Model

A machine learning and simulation-based project designed to model and predict the spread of infectious diseases across a population. Useful for understanding transmission patterns, evaluating containment strategies, and forecasting outbreaks.

## 📌 Objective

To simulate and/or predict how a disease spreads using mathematical models or machine learning algorithms. This project can be extended to analyze the impact of interventions like vaccination, lockdowns, or quarantine.
